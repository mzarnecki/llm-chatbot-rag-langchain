AI chatbot for analysing companies source documents

Posted on 26 May 2024  in projects

https://chat.companyhouse.de/

AI-based chatbot for retrieving reliable, up to date and precise information about companies.Chatbot is based on streamlit framework and uses vector database based on postgres pg_vector extension to store and access trade register documents. Application is using large language model (LLM) Llama3 together with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approach which allows to ask and get response to any question related company and managers history as well as financial condition and important changes.Together with response also source documents are listed making this approach reliable business intelligence tool.

Responsibilities:

build application prototype

implement application code parts

implement authentication mechanism

specify and coordinate works related to building chatbot interactions

specify and coordinate works related to sychronizing in real time source documents and make them accessible for LLM

measure answers quality

ML with PHP – replace complex business logic with machine learning models

Abstract: Have you ever encountered code with so many conditions and processing paths that it was almost impossible to maintain and extend? What if we replaced it with an automatically generated, self-improving algorithm? In recent years, machine learning as a field of artificial intelligence has become an effective tool for creating systems and applications. With the development of artificial neural networks, programming complex business rules and services based on prediction and classification can be replaced by pre-trained machine learning models. In this presentation, you will see a case study illustrating the potential of PHP in integrating machine learning. We will walk through the process of creating a classifier and placing it in a PHP-based project.

Lecture: Exploring the viability of PHP for implementing artificial neural networks: A case study on autonomous vehicle control with CNN model

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an essential tool for developing intelligent systems. With the rise of artificial neural networks, programming languages such as Python and R have become the go-to options for machine learning implementation. But is PHP a viable alternative? In this presentation, we will explore the potential of PHP for implementing artificial neural networks by examining its limitations compared to other popular languages. We will also demonstrate the application of machine learning in PHP through a case study where we trained a convolutional neural network model to control a prototype of an autonomous vehicle using Raspberry Pi and Nvidia’s “DAVE 2” CNN model architecture.
